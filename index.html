            <h3>Life cycle</h3>
            <p>As in a few other types of eusocial bees, a colony generally contains one queen bee, a female; seasonally up to a few thousand drone bees, or males;[24] and tens of thousands of female worker bees.</p>

            <h3>Adult Honey Bee</h3>
            <p>Eventually, a young adult bee will emerge from the hexagonal-shaped egg cell, by chewing its way through the wax capping.

                All in all, from the time the egg was laid, it takes new honey bee queens about 16 days to emerge from the egg cell, whereas workers require between 18 and 22 days to fully develop, and drones need 24 days.</p>

            <h3>Queen Bee</h3>
            <p class="text-container">A productive queen, favoured by the colony and free from disease should certainly live for about 2 yrs, but could live for up to 3 or 4 years or even longer.</p>

            <h3>Hone Bee| Egg</h3>
            <p class="text-container">An egg is laid by the honey bee queen in a wax, hexagonal egg cell.  The egg is about the size of a grain of rice and initially stands upright in the cell.</p>

            <p class="text-container">The larvae are fed by young worker bees that have not yet left the hive or nest..</p>
